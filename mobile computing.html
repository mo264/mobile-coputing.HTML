            Portability: Devices/nodes connected within the mobile computing system should facilitate mobility. These
            devices may have limited device capabilities and limited power supply but should have a sufficient
            processing capability and physical portability to operate in a movable environment.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Devices">
        <p>
            Portable computers, compact, lightweight units including a full character set keyboard and primarily
            intended as hosts for software that may be parameterized, such as laptops/desktops, smartphones/tablets,
            etc.
            Smart cards that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel, and secure area
            access.
            Mobile phones, telephony devices which can call from a distance through cellular networking technology.
            Wearable computers, mostly limited to functional keys and primarily intended as the incorporation of
            software agents, such as bracelets, key-less implants, etc.

        <p>
            Mobile security has become increasingly important in mobile computing. It is of particular concern as it
            relates to the security of personal information now stored on the smartphone. Mobile applications might copy
            user data from these devices to a remote server without the users’ permission and often without the users’
            consent.
            More and more users and businesses use smartphones as a means of planning and organizing their work and
            private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of
            information systems and therefore they have become the source of new risks. Indeed, smartphones collect and
            compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the
            privacy of the user and the intellectual property of the company.

    <div id="Portable computing">
        Several categories of portable computing devices can run on batteries but are not usually classified as laptops: portable computers, PDAs, ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs), tablets, and smartphones.
